## Details of the Screenshot

---

## What I Did

1. **Navigated to the Azure Portal**:  
   I accessed the Microsoft Azure portal via `https://portal.azure.com/` and logged into the organization account.

2. **User Management**:  
   I navigated to the **Users** section under **Microsoft Entra ID** to view the roles assigned to a user.

3. **Assigned Role**:  
   The user `bobby bullock` was assigned the **Global Administrator** role, which gives full administrative privileges over Microsoft Entra ID and related Microsoft services.

4. **Captured the Role Assignment**:  
   A screenshot of the role assignment was taken to document the user's administrative permissions.

## Why This Is Important

The **Global Administrator** role is the highest privilege level in Microsoft Entra ID. It allows the user to:

- Manage all aspects of user and group accounts.
- Control access to all Microsoft services that integrate with Entra identities.
- Assign roles and permissions to other users within the organization.

For security purposes, it is best practice to:

- Limit the number of Global Administrators in your organization.
- Use **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)** to manage role assignments.

---

## Lessons Learned

- **Documentation**: Always document user roles and permissions for auditing and accountability.
- **Security**: Ensure that users with high-level roles like Global Administrator follow strong password policies and enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
